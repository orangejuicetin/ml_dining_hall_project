# KCECH Research Fellows - Machine Learning for Penn Dining Halls

(Update 10/05/19: STILL waiting on research data from Penn dining after they've started ghosting :(( might pivot and change to different dataset, not sure yet but we'll see; model has changed now, just need to commit to repo soon)

All work within folder is for the purpose of my research project done over the summer for the College House research fellows program! Will add more detail to the readme as it progresses. ~
